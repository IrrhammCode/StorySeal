StorySeal is an IP protection platform for AI-generated content that combines invisible watermarking (LSB steganography) with Story Protocol blockchain registration. It enables creators to generate AI assets via ABV.dev or Gemini AI, automatically register them as IP assets on Story Protocol's Aeneid testnet, and embed imperceptible watermarks containing IP IDs directly into image pixels. The platform provides verification tools to detect watermarks even when metadata is removed, monitoring capabilities for IP violations using AI-powered similarity detection, and license management for commercial remix with royalties. Built with Next.js 14, React, TypeScript, and integrated with Story Protocol SDK, StorySeal addresses provenance and ownership challenges in the generative AI era by ensuring every AI-generated asset is verifiable, traceable, and protected on-chain.
