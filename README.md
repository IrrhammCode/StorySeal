# StorySeal 

> **⚠️ SUBMISSION STATUS: PHASE 1 (WEEK 1-2)**
> *Current Progress: Concept, Architecture & Initial Setup*

## Project Description
StorySeal is a platform that ensures Generative AI assets are authentic and traceable. We combine AI generation with invisible watermarking to protect creators' intellectual property on Story Protocol, even if metadata is stripped.

## Selected Tracks
We are submitting this project for:
1.  **Main Track:** IP Detection & Enforcement ($5,000)
2.  **Partner Bounty:** GenAI IP Registration Challenge (ABV.dev)

## How It Works
1.  **Generate & Register:** Users create assets using **ABV.dev**, which automatically registers them on Story Protocol.
2.  **Invisible Watermark:** StorySeal embeds a steganographic watermark (IP ID) into the image pixels.
3.  **Detection:** A public verification tool detects the watermark and retrieves the original IP ownership from the blockchain.

## Tech Stack
* **Frontend:** Next.js, Tailwind CSS
* **GenAI & IP:** ABV.dev API
* **Blockchain:** Story Protocol SDK
* **Security:** Python (Steganography/Watermarking)
